# workbench-gpg

GPG key lifecycle management for the
[`workbench`](https://github.com/GingerGraham/workbench-core) ecosystem.

An **ecosystem module** (`workbench-core` ARCHITECTURE.md §2) — meaningless
standalone. Requires `workbench-core` installed first:

```sh
wb add gpg
# or, as part of a bundle:
wb install --bundle workstation
```

GPG support spans two shell files:

- `shell/gpg.sh` — tier `tools`, loaded whenever `gpg` is in `$PATH`. Fast
  inspection and listing functions always available.
- `shell/gpg-management.sh` — tier `lazy`. Interactive key lifecycle
  operations: creation, export, import, rotation, and backup. (Note: this
  is the last tier the loader sources, not a true deferred-until-first-call
  stub the way `workbench-precursor`'s `lazy/` directory worked —
  `workbench-core`'s loader has no such mechanism yet. Functionally
  identical either way, since these functions are only ever invoked
  interactively.)

These functions integrate with two password managers for key backup
(**Bitwarden** and **1Password**, via `workbench-security`'s
`install-bw-cli`/`install-op-cli`) and two git providers for publishing your
signing key (**GitHub** and **GitLab**, via `workbench-git`'s
`install-gh`/`install-glab`). Use whichever combination matches your setup —
function names follow the pattern `gpg-<action>-<service>`, so an
equivalent exists for each supported service.

## Key structure

The recommended structure created by `gpg-create-key` is a master key with
separate subkeys for each capability:

```text
Master key  [C]    certify only — sign other keys and subkeys
  └─ Subkey [S]    sign — git commits, tags, files
  └─ Subkey [E]    encrypt — files and secrets
  └─ Subkey [A]    authenticate — SSH and API access (optional)
```

The master key is used only for certifying: creating subkeys, signing other
people's keys, and extending expiry. Day-to-day operations use subkeys
exclusively. This means:

- If a subkey is compromised, it can be revoked and replaced without losing
  your identity
- The master key can be exported and stored offline (Bitwarden, 1Password,
  encrypted USB) and then **removed from the local keyring** so it is never
  exposed during normal use
- Git commit signing uses the `[S]` subkey fingerprint, not the master key

When the master key is needed again (adding a subkey, extending expiry,
certifying another key), import it from your backup, perform the
operation, then remove it again.

## Prerequisites

`gpg` must be installed. On Fedora it is present by default; on
Ubuntu/Debian install `gnupg2`. `gpg.sh` guards itself with `command -v gpg`
and will not load if GPG is absent.

For backup and restore functions, install and authenticate **one or both**
of the supported password manager CLIs (both live in `workbench-security`).
The function families work identically — pick whichever matches your vault.

### Bitwarden (`bw`)

```bash
install-bw-cli                          # install the headless CLI
bw login                                # first-time authentication
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)    # unlock and capture session token
```

`BW_SESSION` must be set in the current shell for any `gpg-*-bitwarden`
function to work. It is not persisted across sessions by design — re-run
the `export` line after each login.

### 1Password (`op`)

```bash
install-op-cli                          # 1Password CLI only
# or, for biometric unlock support:
install-1password                       # 1Password desktop app
op signin                                # authenticate (not needed if using
                                          # desktop app biometric integration)
```

`gpg-*-1password` functions accept an optional `--vault <name>` to target a
specific vault; without it, `op`'s default vault is used.

### Backup naming convention

Both families store the same set of items — public key, secret key,
subkeys-only, revocation certificate, and an optional passphrase — using
the naming convention:

```text
<type> — [<qualifier>] <uid> (<fingerprint>)
```

`<qualifier>` defaults to the short hostname (`hostname -s`) so backups
from different machines are distinct and never clobber each other.
Override it with `--name <label>`.

## Typical workflow: new machine setup

### 1. Check for existing keys

```bash
gpg-list-signing-keys
```

If you have keys backed up already, import them instead of creating new ones:

```bash
# Bitwarden
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-import-bitwarden          # search vault interactively

# 1Password
gpg-import-1password          # search vault interactively

gpg-trust <fingerprint>        # set ultimate trust on your own key
```

### 2. Create a new key set

If starting from scratch:

```bash
gpg-create-key
```

The wizard prompts for name, email, optional comment, master key expiry
(default: no expiry), and subkey expiry (default: 2 years). It creates the
master `[C]` key and `[S]`/`[E]` subkeys in one pass, then prints the
recommended next steps with the specific commands for your new key's
fingerprint.

### 3. Generate a revocation certificate

Do this immediately after key creation, before the key is used anywhere:

```bash
gpg-revoke <fingerprint>
```

The certificate is saved to `~/.gnupg/revocations/<fingerprint>-revocation.asc`.
It is also stored as part of your backup in the next step. If your key is
ever compromised, importing this certificate and uploading it to a
keyserver revokes the key publicly.

### 4. Back up your keys

```bash
# Bitwarden
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-export-bitwarden <fingerprint>

# 1Password
gpg-export-1password <fingerprint>
# target a specific vault:
gpg-export-1password <fingerprint> --vault "Secrets"
```

Each stores four items:

| Item name                                            | Contents                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `GPG Public Key — [<host>] <uid> (<fp>)`             | Armoured public key                  |
| `GPG Secret Key — [<host>] <uid> (<fp>)`             | Full secret key (master + subkeys)   |
| `GPG Subkeys Only — [<host>] <uid> (<fp>)`           | Subkeys only, no master key material |
| `GPG Revocation Certificate — [<host>] <uid> (<fp>)` | Revocation certificate               |

If a passphrase is entered when prompted, it is also stored as a separate
Login item: `GPG Key Passphrase — [<host>] <uid> (<fp>)`.

Re-running either export after a rotation updates the existing items rather
than creating duplicates.

### 5. Remove the master key from local keyring

Once your keys are backed up, remove the master key's secret material from
this machine:

```bash
gpg-remove-master <fingerprint>
```

The function verifies you've confirmed the backup, then removes only the
primary secret key — subkeys remain intact. Afterwards the key shows as
`sec#` in `gpg --list-secret-keys`, meaning the public key and subkeys are
present but the master secret is offline.

Your subkeys are sufficient for all day-to-day operations: signing commits,
encrypting files, and SSH authentication.

### 6. Wire up git commit signing

```bash
gpg-list-signing-keys your@email.com
```

This prints the long key ID of your `[S]` subkey and the exact
`git-add-project` command to run (`workbench-git`):

```bash
git-add-project Personal GitHub your@email.com <signing-subkey-id>
```

The same applies for any other provider — substitute `GitLab`,
`Bitbucket`, `AzureDevOps`, etc. for the context's `provider` value.

Or to add signing to an existing project:

```bash
git-update-project Personal GitHub --signing-key <signing-subkey-id>
```

To set a default signing key globally (used by `workbench-git`'s
`git-setup-identity` for any context with no project-specific key set):

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey <signing-subkey-id>
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global tag.gpgsign true
```

(`workbench-precursor` templated this from `host_vars/localhost.yml` via
Ansible on every run — `workbench-core` has no host_vars concept, so this
is a one-time manual step, or re-run `git-setup-identity` and supply it
when prompted.)

## Key lifecycle

### Adding UIDs (email aliases)

UIDs are always added to the **master key** (`[C]`), never to subkeys.
Subkeys carry no identity — they inherit it from the master.
`gpg-add-uid` only lists master keys for this reason; the signing subkey
fingerprint you may see in `gpg --list-secret-keys` output is not a valid
target for a UID.

```bash
gpg-add-uid                      # interactive: lists master keys, prompts for email
gpg-add-uid <master-fingerprint> # non-interactive key selection
```

Common use cases:

- GitHub noreply address: `<id>+username@users.noreply.github.com`
- GitLab noreply address: `<id>-<username>@users.noreply.gitlab.com`
- Work email alias
- Alternate personal address

Both GitHub and GitLab verify signed commits against **any UID on the
key** — you do not need to set a provider's noreply address as the primary
UID, and doing so is usually wrong. Leave your real email as primary.

After `gpg-add-uid` completes, the new UID will show as `[ unknown]` trust
in `gpg --list-keys`. This is expected — ownertrust is set on the key as a
whole, not per-UID, but GPG resets the display state when a UID is added.
The function re-applies ultimate ownertrust automatically. If you see
`[ unknown]` persisting, run:

```bash
gpg-trust <master-fingerprint>
```

Re-export your backup after adding a UID so it reflects the new identity:

```bash
gpg-export-bitwarden <master-fingerprint>     # or: gpg-export-1password
```

The master secret key must be present locally to add a UID. If it has been
removed, import it first, add the UID, re-export, then remove it again:

```bash
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-import-bitwarden          # or: gpg-import-1password
gpg-add-uid <fingerprint>
gpg-export-bitwarden <fingerprint>    # or: gpg-export-1password
gpg-remove-master <fingerprint>
```

### Extending expiry

```bash
gpg-extend-expiry <fingerprint> 2y
```

This extends both the master key and all subkeys. The master secret key
must be present locally — if it has been removed, import it first:

```bash
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-import-bitwarden                  # or: gpg-import-1password
gpg-extend-expiry <fingerprint> 2y
gpg-export-bitwarden <fingerprint>    # or: gpg-export-1password — update backup with new expiry
gpg-remove-master <fingerprint>       # take master offline again
```

### Rotating a subkey

Rotation replaces an individual subkey without changing your identity:

```bash
gpg-rotate-subkey <master-fp> <subkey-fp> sign 2y
```

Interactive mode (no arguments) will list available subkeys and prompt for
each value. The same import-operate-export-remove workflow applies when
the master is offline.

After rotation:

1. Update git projects that reference the old subkey ID:
   `git-update-project <ctx> <prov> --signing-key <new-subkey-id>`
2. Re-export your backup: `gpg-export-bitwarden <master-fp>` (or
   `gpg-export-1password`)
3. Remove master again: `gpg-remove-master <master-fp>`

### Restoring the master key temporarily

```bash
# Bitwarden
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-import-bitwarden                  # imports the full secret key

# 1Password
gpg-import-1password                  # imports the full secret key

# ... perform master-key operations ...

gpg-export-bitwarden <fingerprint>    # or: gpg-export-1password — update backup if anything changed
gpg-remove-master <fingerprint>       # take it offline again
```

### New machine from existing backup

```bash
# Bitwarden
export BW_SESSION=$(bw unlock --raw)
gpg-import-bitwarden "GPG Subkeys Only — …"   # import subkeys only

# 1Password
gpg-import-1password "GPG Subkeys Only — …"   # import subkeys only

gpg-trust <fingerprint>                        # set ultimate trust
```

Import the subkeys-only item rather than the full secret key — there is no
reason to put the master key on a new daily-use machine.

A key exported to a file can also be imported directly:

```bash
gpg-import ~/transfer/gpg-<fp>-subkeys-only.asc
gpg-trust <fingerprint>
```

## Publishing your signing key

Once your signing subkey exists, publish its public key to your git
provider so signed commits show as verified.

```bash
gpg-push-github     # interactive key selection
gpg-push-gitlab     # interactive key selection
```

Both accept an explicit key ID to skip interactive selection, e.g.
`gpg-push-github <key-id>`. Each requires the matching provider CLI
(`workbench-git`) to be installed and authenticated first:

```bash
install-gh    && gh auth login      # for gpg-push-github
install-glab  && glab auth login    # for gpg-push-gitlab
```

`gpg-push-github` reports duplicates if the key is already registered;
`gpg-push-gitlab` does the same.

## Agent management

```bash
gpg-agent-restart    # restart the agent after config changes
gpg-agent-forget     # clear cached passphrases without restart
gpg-card-status      # show YubiKey / smartcard status
```

## Pinentry

GPG needs a pinentry frontend to prompt for passphrases. Minimal and WSL
images commonly don't ship one, which surfaces as:

```bash
gpg: signing failed: No pinentry

# or

gpg: agent_genkey failed: No pinentry
```

`gpg-create-key` detects this automatically and offers to run
`install-pinentry` and retry inline, reusing the identity and expiry
details already entered. To install pinentry manually ahead of time, or if
you decline the prompt:

```bash
install-pinentry
```

This installs a terminal-capable frontend (curses/tty) via the platform
package manager — no display or GUI dependency required. On macOS it
installs `pinentry-mac` via Homebrew; for Touch ID / keychain-backed
prompts, also set `pinentry-program` in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf` to its
path (printed by `install-pinentry` on completion).

## GPG_TTY

`gpg.sh` sets `GPG_TTY=$(tty)` at source time. This is required for
`pinentry-curses` to work correctly in terminals without a display (SSH
sessions, tmux panes, headless servers). If you see
`gpg: signing failed: Inappropriate ioctl for device`, ensure this
variable is set:

```bash
echo $GPG_TTY     # should show something like /dev/pts/0
```

If it is empty, add to `~/.config/workbench/local/settings.sh`:

```bash
export GPG_TTY=$(tty)
```
